        <p class="lead mb-4">I grew up surrounded by all kinds of pets in my home, which helped me develop a deep love and respect for animals from a very young age. However, my connection with animals became especially meaningful when I got my first cat at the age of 15. From the moment I met him, I completely fell in love with cats. They are incredibly adorable, independent, affectionate, and full of personality. Over time, he became more than just a pet — he became my best friend and a source of comfort and happiness in my life. Seeing how loving and gentle he was made it difficult for me to understand why cats often face abuse, neglect, or negative stereotypes. Because of this, I made a personal promise to myself that I would always try to help cats feel safe, loved, and cared for. When I was 19 years old, I welcomed another cat into my life, and he quickly became like my son. Both of my cats have taught me patience, responsibility, and unconditional love, and I truly believe I was lucky to have found them.
<br><br>

        Because of the love and joy my cats have brought into my life, I now want to help more cats who may not have experienced kindness or trust before. My goal is to open my home to cats in need and provide them with a safe and caring environment where they can rebuild confidence, form friendships, and learn that not all humans are harmful. Watching animals heal emotionally and physically brings me a deep sense of fulfillment and purpose. I want every cat that comes into my care to feel valued, protected, and loved. I believe animals deserve second chances, and I am committed to being someone who can provide those opportunities for them.<br><br>

        Looking toward the future, I have a dream of turning my passion into a meaningful business by opening a cat café. This café would include a playful and safe environment for rescued cats while also welcoming visitors who love animals. It would serve as a relaxing space where people can spend time with cats, learn about responsible pet care, and even adopt animals who need homes. I am currently attending school and majoring in business so I can gain the knowledge and skills necessary to make this dream a reality. Along with my education, I am gaining experience by visiting cat lounges, researching animal care practices, and working as a full-time pet sitter. Overall, my goal is to build a business that helps animals while bringing happiness to people, and I hope to create a space where cats feel safe, loved, and appreciated while building a welcoming environment for fellow cat lovers.
